                 <p class="text-secondary pb-4">Edmark is such a good developer. He has knowledge on HTML, CSS
                     and database management. Easy to work with, you just have to be clear with what you expect
                     on a website. He is able to easily integrate new website development ideas into what is
                     expected by the client. He has a potential on advanced development and design platforms.
